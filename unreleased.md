# Unreleased Changes

All upcoming features and bug fixes will be documented here until they are part of an official release.

### Changed
- **Options Tab**: The "Enable *arr Integration" label now dynamically changes to "Disable *arr Integration" when the integration is enabled, and vice versa.
- **Options Tab**: When an *arr integration is disabled, all related options (host, API key, secondary switches like "Create Rename Jobs in Queue" and "Auto-Rename After Transcode", and the Test Connection button) are now also disabled.
- **Tools Tab**: Simplified section headers from "*arr Tools" to just "*arr" (e.g., "Sonarr Tools" → "Sonarr").
