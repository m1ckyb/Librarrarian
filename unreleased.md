# Unreleased Changes

All upcoming features and bug fixes will be documented here until they are part of an official release.

### Changed
- Standardized all button styles across the application to use outline buttons (`btn-outline-*`) with consistent color coding and Material Design Icons, matching the style introduced in PR #52 for global node controls
- Updated button styling guidelines in project documentation (remember.md, GEMINI.md, and copilot-instructions.md)
