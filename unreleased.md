# Unreleased Changes

All upcoming features and bug fixes will be documented here until they are part of an official release.

### Changed
- **Active Nodes Footer Layout**: Moved the ETA badge from the left side (next to Uptime) to the right side (next to Codec) for better visual grouping of transcoding metrics. The ETA now always displays when a node is actively transcoding, showing "N/A" or "Calculating..." when the estimate is not yet available.
