# Unreleased Changes

All upcoming features and bug fixes will be documented here until they are part of an official release.

### Changed
- **Release Process**: Updated `remember.md` to explicitly forbid adding an `[Unreleased]` section to `CHANGELOG.md` during a release, keeping it clean for released versions only.
